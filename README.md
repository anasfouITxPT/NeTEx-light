# NeTEx-light

The normative NeTEx schema could be considered very big and extensive. 
Code generation tools for C# have difficulties with processing it. In order to use NeTEx within C# this derived XSD was created by DATA4PT (https://data4pt-project.eu/).  
This schema should be used informative, for application development, but not for validation purposes. 
This schema has been reduced to only match the scope of the EPIP (European Passengenger Information Profile) but remains compliant with the main NeTEx Schema.
A graphic interactive technical presentation is available here https://data4pt.org/wiki/NeTEX#NeTEx-Light.
